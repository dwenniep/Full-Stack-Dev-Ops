<h2>Making our first page</h2>
<p>It is possible to make websites using these extremely simple tools.
This is great news as it means everyone can learn to make websites.</p>
<p>For now we only have a simple page, but later we will make it more complex 
and interesting.

<h2>What have we learned so far?</h2>
<p>So far we have learned a few simple tags for placing text onto a page.
The internet is a network of computers which spans the entire world.
The internet is a decentralized network – in other words, every computer 
connected to it is treated the same. There are no special internet servers 
which control the whole internet, but some servers have a special role which 
we will discuss in later lessons.

Computers which have content that people want to access are often called ‘servers’ 
because they serve up that content to other computers.
In practice, the internet is made up of many (many!) computers all around the world 
connected together by dedicated infrastructure. It is impossible to know exactly how 
many computers there are on the internet, but it is estimated there were more than 
100,000,000 servers online by 2013. Imagine huge rooms filled with computers, joined 
by cables that cover every country and go under every ocean – that is what the internet 
is like physically! It doesn’t matter to us where the computers are or how we are connected 
to them – once you’re connected to the internet you can talk to any of the other computers.
